### Hey there! 👋

I'm Gunjan, a Data Science master's student passionate about transforming data into impactful solutions. My background in Computer Science and ongoing studies in Data Science have armed me with the skills to tackle multifaceted challenges in the tech sphere.

### Exploring Projects 🔍:

🚗**WooAuto: List Your Car!**: A dynamic platform I developed using Django, allowing users to explore and list automobiles. I optimized its performance and responsiveness, ensuring a seamless experience for users. Dive into the [code](https://github.com/gjoshi22/automobiles) or check out the [live site](https://automobileswoo-f4fbbfd878bf.herokuapp.com/).

🌾**HarvestHero: ML Insights into Crop Vitality**: An initiative where I employed machine learning to predict crop survival with 84% accuracy, providing farmers with valuable insights for better decision-making. Here's the detailed [analysis](https://github.com/gjoshi22/HarvestHero-Machine-Learning-Insights-into-Crop-Vitality/blob/main/Crop_plantation_output_prediction.ipynb).

🧑‍💼**Stay or Stray: ML Projections on Employee Retention**: I achieved a 98% accuracy in predicting employee attrition risks, providing businesses with actionable insights to retain talent. Explore the [work](https://github.com/gjoshi22/Stay-or-Stray-Machine-Learning-Projections-on-Employee-Retention-/blob/main/Employee_churn_prediction_(turnover_prediction).ipynb).

When I'm not diving into datasets or coding up a storm, you might find me playing the guitar, playing soccer,  or experimenting with a new recipe in the kitchen 🍳.
